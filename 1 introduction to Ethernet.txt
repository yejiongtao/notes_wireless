1. coaxial Ethernet
	employs a bus topology
	every computer sends Ethernet signals over a single bus cable
	a failure anywhere on the cable brings the entire network system to a halt
twisted-pair Ethernet
	star-wired cabling topology, in which the computers are all connected to a central point
100 Mb/s Ethernet
	multispeed twisted-pair Ethernet interfaces could be built, operating at either 10 or 100 Mb/s
	uses the Auto-Negotiation protocol to automatically configure the speed
Gigabit Ethernet
10,40,100 Gb/s Ethernet
	full-duplex

2. PoE, Power over Ethernet
	provide power for the device using the Ethernet cable
	widely adopted for deploying wireless APs
